# 🚀 Building a Large Language Model (LLM) from Scratch  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an end-to-end implementation of a **Transformer-based Language Model**, inspired by **"Attention is All You Need"** and OpenAI’s **GPT-3**.  
We will train our model using **Lambda GPU Cloud** and provide an alternative implementation using **Google Colab** for ease of access.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### ⚡ GPU Setup
We use **Lambda GPU Cloud** for training.  
Alternatively, **Google Colab** can be used for quick experimentation.

🔗 **Lambda Labs** → [Spin up an on-demand GPU](https://lambdalabs.com)  
🔗 **Google Colab** → Works best for notebooks.

### 🔧 Environment Setup  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/LLM-from-Scratch.git
cd LLM-from-Scratch
python -m venv llm_env
source llm_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `llm_env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🏛️ Model Architecture  
The model is implemented based on the **Transformer** architecture from *"Attention is All You Need"*, focusing on self-attention mechanisms and multi-head attention.

### 🔹 Key Components:
- **Tokenization & Preprocessing**: Implemented **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**  
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures dependencies between words  
- **Feed-Forward Layers**: Improves feature extraction  
- **Positional Encodings**: Provides sequence information  
- **Layer Normalization & Dropout**: Enhances training stability
